# Resolution Roulette
Resolution Roulette is a tool to help with self-improvement by randomly generating challenges in various categories all with the goal of pushing individuals to be better versions of themselves. It also generates a creative punishment to go with the challenge if the person were to fail to complete their task. Resolution Roulette is highly customizable with an editable task list, categories tailored to span all aspects of self-improvement, and different levels of difficulty to fit everyone's individual resolutions!

## Try it out!
To try out the project, first download everything as a zip folder (click on the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP").
