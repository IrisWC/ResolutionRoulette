# Resolution Roulette

## Try it out!
To try out the project, first download everything as a zip folder (click on the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP"). 
Then, unzip the file and run the jar file inside (called "Resolution Roulette.jar"). <br />
This should work on most computers. If it doesn't, try importing the folder with its contents into an environment and running it from there.
